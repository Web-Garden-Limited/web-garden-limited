# Welcome to Web Garden!

## Who am I?

My name is David Conlisk and I am a freelance mobile app developer based in Glasgow, Scotland.

I have over 20 years of industry experience building websites and mobile apps for a variety of clients. I thrive in the fast-pasted agency environment, working with agile methodologies to tight deadlines.

## Current technologies
- **Xamarin Forms**. For the past number of years I have been using Xamarin Forms full-time for my clients. At the moment I am helping to create cross-platform apps for the medical industry with my client Clevermed Limited in Edinburgh. 
- **C#** - because most apps need an API to communicate with, I am comfortable working on API design, architecture, and implementation, including the data layer.
- **Flutter** - I have recently been getting into Google Flutter and I've released my first app using it, the Bristol Stool Chart.
- **Amazon Alexa** - I love building voice skills and I have a number of skills in the Alexa marketplace.
