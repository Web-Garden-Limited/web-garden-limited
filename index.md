# Welcome to Web Garden!

My name is David Conlisk and I am a senior software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland.

I have over 25 years of industry experience building websites and mobile apps for a variety of clients. I thrive in the
fast-paced agency environment, working with agile methodologies to tight deadlines.

## Current technologies

- **React Native** - I have been using React Native on a daily basis since January 2023 to build cross-platform mobile apps.
  While working for V.Group, I led the Mobile Application Group, where I made all architectural and technical decisions related
  to the delivery of mobile apps across the business. Since then I've been working with Waracle as a senior React Native developer,
  working on apps for clients in the financial services industry.

- **React and Node** - I spent six months investigating the MERN Javascript technology stack
  (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/home" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>,
  <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>,
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a>) using
  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> in order to
  volunteer for <a href="https://opencrvs.org" target="_blank">OpenCRVS</a>,
  a digital public good providing software for civil registrations for use by developing countries.

- **Flutter** - I have been using <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Google Flutter</a> since 2020 which I
  really enjoy. I have a Flutter app in the app stores, the
  <a href="https://bristolstoolchart.net" target="_blank">Bristol Stool Chart</a>.
  It is completely free to use and fully open source.

## Previous experience

- **Xamarin Forms** - I spent seven years using Xamarin and Xamarin Forms full-time for my clients, including Screenmedia,
  Clevermed and VShips.

- **Umbraco** - I spent many years building websites for clients using Umbraco. This included everything from simple
  brochure sites, to multi-site integration projects with custom components. I also set up and ran the Glasgow Umbraco
  Users Group for a number of years.

- **C# and .NET** - I started using .NET in 2003, and I am comfortable working on API design, implementation and
  integration. Anywhere you can use C# (I built my first mobile app using the .NET Compact Framework in 2004).

- **Voice** - I love building voice skills and I have experience building an award winning voice skill for Alexa and
  Google Home for a well known TV show. I also have a couple of skills active for Alexa,

## Personal projects

<a href="https://bristolstoolchart.net" target="_blank">The Bristol Stool Chart</a>

This was originally my first native iOS app built back in 2011 as a prototype for future medical app development.
When it stopped working in 2015 due to an iOS update, I started to get emails from frustrated users, and I realised
that a lot of people find it useful in managing their medical conditions. I then redeveloped it as a cross-platform
(iOS and Android) app using Xamarin Forms and Grialkit UI. I rebuilt the app again in 2020 using Google Flutter, and
again in 2021 to demonstrate good Flutter architecture. It has always been free, and now it is also
<a href="https://github.com/dconlisk/bristol-stool-chart-flutter-app" target="_blank">100% open source and available
to view on github</a>.

I finally moved this website and the Bristol Stool Chart site from a creaky old Umbraco 4 instance to GitHub Pages.
Using markdown with Jekyll and pre-built themes is just so easy! It's free for one organisation site along with one site
per repository. I highly recommend it.
