## Current technologies
- **Xamarin Forms**. For the past number of years I have been using Xamarin Forms full-time for my clients. At the moment I am helping to create cross-platform apps for the medical industry with my client Clevermed Limited in Edinburgh. 

- **C# and .NET** - I am comfortable working on API design, implementation and integration. 

- **Flutter** - I have recently been getting into Google Flutter and the Dart language. I've released my first app using Flutter, the <a href="https://bristolstoolchart.net" target="_blank">Bristol Stool Chart</a>. It is completely free to use and fully open source. <a href="https://github.com/dconlisk/bristol-stool-chart-flutter-app" target="_blank">View the source code on github</a> 

- **Voice** - I love building voice skills and I have experience building an award winning voice skill for Alexa and Google Home for a well known TV show. I also have a couple of skills active for Alexa, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Garden-Limited-Daybreak-Yoga/dp/B079542ZNV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=web+garden+limited&qid=1593259714&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Daybreak Yoga</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Garden-Limited-Tea-Guide/dp/B076JGKSLJ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=web+garden+limited&qid=1593259776&s=digital-skills&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tea Guide</a>.

This was originally my first native iOS app built back in 2011 as a prototype for future medical app development. When it stopped working in 2015 due to an iOS update, I started to get emails from frustrated users, and I realised that a lot of people find it useful in managing their medical conditions. I then redeveloped it as a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app using Xamarin Forms and Grialkit. I have rebuilt the app once again in 2020 using Google Flutter and the Dart language.

This is an app designed for users with memory impairments to help them in completing the activities of daily living. It uses speech and voice recognition to talk the user through the completion of a task if they are having trouble sequencing the steps required. It is being trialled with service users at the moment in Glasgow.
