# Welcome to Web Garden!

## Current technologies

- **React and Node** - I am currently investigating the MERN Javascript technology stack (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/home" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a>) using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> which is really interesting.

- **Flutter** - I have been using <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Google Flutter</a> commercially since January 2021 which I really enjoy. I have a Flutter app in the app stores, the <a href="https://bristolstoolchart.net" target="_blank">Bristol Stool Chart</a>. It is completely free to use and fully open source. <a href="https://github.com/dconlisk/bristol-stool-chart-flutter-app" target="_blank">View the source code on github</a>

## Previous experience

- **Xamarin Forms** - I spent seven years using Xamarin and Xamarin Forms full-time for my clients, including Screenmedia, Clevermed and VShips.

- **C# and .NET** - I started using .NET in 2003, and I am comfortable working on API design, implementation and integration. Anywhere you can use C# (I built my first mobile app in .NET 1.1 in 2004).

- **Voice** - I love building voice skills and I have experience building an award winning voice skill for Alexa and Google Home for a well known TV show. I also have a couple of skills active for Alexa, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Garden-Limited-Daybreak-Yoga/dp/B079542ZNV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=web+garden+limited&qid=1593259714&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Daybreak Yoga</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Garden-Limited-Tea-Guide/dp/B076JGKSLJ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=web+garden+limited&qid=1593259776&s=digital-skills&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tea Guide</a>.

## Personal projects

<a href="https://bristolstoolchart.net" target="_blank">The Bristol Stool Chart</a>

This was originally my first native iOS app built back in 2011 as a prototype for future medical app development. When it stopped working in 2015 due to an iOS update, I started to get emails from frustrated users, and I realised that a lot of people find it useful in managing their medical conditions. I then redeveloped it as a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app using Xamarin Forms and Grialkit. I rebuilt the app again in 2020 using Google Flutter, and again in 2021 to demonstrate good Flutter architecture. It has always been free, and now it is also <a href="https://github.com/dconlisk/bristol-stool-chart-flutter-app" target="_blank">100% open source and available to view on github</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/dconlisk" target="_blank">My Github</a>

I've recently moved this website and the Bristol Stool Chart site from a creaky old Umbraco 4 instance to GitHub Pages. Using markdown with Jekyll and pre-built themes is just so easy! It's free for one organisation site along with one site per repository. I highly recommend it.
